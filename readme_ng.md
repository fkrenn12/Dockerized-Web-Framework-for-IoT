## 📝 Overview

🛠️ **Flexible & Modular Service Management:**  
This project provides a flexible and modular approach to managing various services using Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file serves as the central configuration to include, configure, and manage services such as **Traefik**, **MariaDB**, **Node-RED**, **Mosquitto**, and more. 

⚙️ **Customizable Setup:**  
It is designed to support a wide range of use cases, from basic service setups to more complex configurations for development or deployment environments. By simply including or uncommenting specific `docker-compose-*.yml` files, users can tailor the setup to match their requirements. 

🚀 **Simplicity, Scalability & Modularity:**  
The project emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and modularity, making it ideal for quickly deploying and testing multiple services while maintaining clean and organized configurations.
